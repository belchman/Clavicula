# Error Pattern Analysis

Scan all pipeline run logs for recurring error patterns.

## Process

1. Read all files matching `docs/artifacts/pipeline-runs/*/verify-*.json`
2. Extract error messages and failure reasons
3. Cluster similar errors (same file, same error type, same root cause)
4. For each cluster with 3+ occurrences:
   a. Identify the systemic cause
   b. Generate a prevention rule
   c. Add to `.claude/rules/` as a new rule or append to existing
   d. If the fix is a code change, write prescription to `docs/artifacts/prescriptions/`

## Output
- `docs/artifacts/error-analysis-[date].md` with full cluster analysis
- New/updated rules in `.claude/rules/`

This is the "Healer" pattern: observe, cluster, diagnose, prescribe, verify.
